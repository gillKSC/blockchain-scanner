# Database Project: Ethereum Blockchain Scanner

This project is a simple blockchain scanner on the Ethereum blockchain. We will use a SQL database to store all the data. We will insert the data into the database by running a NodeJS script that communicates with the ethereum blockchain API and fetches all relevant blockchain data. We will only retrieve data from a specific time range due to the large amount of data on the Ethereum blockchain.

We will also provide a simple web interface for users to interact with the blockchain scanner. The server will be built in NodeJS.

Run frontend by
