# Database Project: Ethereum Blockchain Scanner

This project is a simple blockchain scanner demo of the Ethereum blockchain. We will use a SQL database to store all the data. We will insert the data into the database by running a NodeJS script that communicates with the ethereum blockchain API and fetches all relevant blockchain data.

we will also provide a simple web interface for users to interact with the blockchain scanner. We will use NodeJS to build the server.
